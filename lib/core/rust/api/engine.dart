/// The main entry point for running a comprehensive network check.
///
/// This function orchestrates the entire check process:
/// 1. Records the start time.
/// 2. Collects multiple latency samples by running probes against all configured targets.
/// 3. Computes detailed latency and stability statistics from the samples.
/// 4. Evaluates the final connection quality based on speed, jitter, and packet loss.
/// 5. Detects the network interface type and checks for security issues like VPNs.
/// 6. Performs a DNS hijacking check if configured.
/// 7. Compiles all results into a single, comprehensive [NetworkReport].
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `config` - The [NetworkConfiguration] that defines how the check should be performed.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A [NetworkReport] containing the complete results of the check.
